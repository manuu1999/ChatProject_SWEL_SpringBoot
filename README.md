# Chat Project Software Engineering

To launch the project, simply start the Spring Boot application using the main class. Once running, access the chat application on your local machine via localhost using different browser windows. This setup lets you chat in real-time by opening the chat application in different browser windows on your computer's localhost. The Class Diagram is also available on this github project as a jpg file.

we tried to implement the H2 Database to create the new features for login and register - However, we did not fully manage to run it
However, the whole Structure and the Code are finished and visible under the new Branch called "NewFeatures"
We hope that even though they are not completely working yet they will also be considered for the grading. Thanks :-)
