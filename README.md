We had to create a new project to implement the structure of a springboot project with the spring initializr
The old project is on the repository: ADD REPOSITORX URL HERE

Furthermore, we used Websocket instead of HTTP Connection to make the chat application more dynamic, since with the websocket API you can leave the connection open. We hope that this is okey :-)
